# Factors that can affect performance

***
## Main factors
- Clock speed
- Number of cores
- Cache memory

## Clock speed
Every cpu activity is begun with a clock pulse. The more of these clock pulses there are per second the more instructions can be ran. Speeding up the clock speed will allow the processor.
## Number of cores
If there are several cores in a CPU, the CPU can then run more than one instruction at once. 
## Cache
Cache allows for the CPU to store data and instructions closer to the CPU which is faster than fetching from primary memory.
