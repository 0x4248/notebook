# Functions of an Operating System

***
## Primary functions of an Operating system
- Memory management
- Interrupt service routines
- Processor scheduling
- Backing store management
- Management of all inputs and outputs
### Memory management
Memory management in an operating system allows for memory to be allocated efficiently  
### Interrupts
An interrupt is a signal from software or hardware that can trigger a function.
### Processor scheduling
In order for computers to run multiple tasks at once there needs to be scheduling. Scheduling allows for the CPU to allocate processing time to each process.

#### Round robin
In a round robin system process are on a first in first out basis. Each process takes its turn.

#### First come first serve
In a first come first serve, jobs are processed in the order that that are executed. There is no priority in place.
#### Shortest job first
The smallest processes are ran first before running larger jobs.
