# 2D Arrays
<p class="center" style="margin:0;color:gray;">Subtitle</p>

***
2D arrays are arrays of arrays. 
## Example of a 2D array

| [R,C] | 0     | 1     | 2     | 3     |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | [0,0] | [0,1] | [0,2] | [0,3] |
| 1     | [1,0] | [1,1] | [1,2] | [1,3] |
| 2     | [2,0] | [2,1] | [2,2] | [2,3] |
| 3     | [3,0] | [3,1] | [3,2] | [3,3] |
The table shows a 2D array with the index's on them. Below is the same table with data in the table.

|     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 12  | 32  | 28  | 29  |
| 1   | 23  | 38  | 29  | 21  |
| 2   | 53  | 24  | 10  | 39  |
| 3   | 38  | 96  | 73  | 28  |
For example if we call:
```
Array[2,1]
```
We should get the following result.
```
24
```
