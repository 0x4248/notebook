# Translation 
***
Translation is where code is converted from one programming language into another. This process is also called porting.
## Reasons to translate a program
- The old programming language can not meet the needs for the solution.
- Support for the existing programming language is ending.
- Existing programming language has identified security flaws.
- Change of hardware makes it hard to use the old language.
- Change of business/industry/sector policy regarding preferred programming language.
- Availability of developers with suitable experience.
## Drawbacks of translating a program
- New solution may be inferior to the original which could effect the performance.
- Solution may be not as efficient.
- Solution may prove overly time consuming to port to new language.
- Developers for new programming language may be scarce and therefore expensive to hire and/or train.
- Less community knowledge about new programming language to help with bugs.
