# Update: 01-01-2025
<p class="text-center" style="margin:0;color:gray;">A new year, a new site</p>

***
For almost two years now, I have been using obsidian to take notes on various things. Over this period I have also made many sub sections on my site (*such as a wiki and a blog*). Using this method I have then found it hard to update information, and for people using my website it can be hard to find this information. 
## How do we fix this?
For the past few weeks now I have thought of combining all the sub sites:
- Blogs
- Wiki
- Pages
- And some of my vaults
And then turning it into one site where everything is easy to access, and for me it means its easy for me to publish new content. 

From now on the "sub sites" on `0x4248.dev` will no longer be updated and will be archived on GitHub. The only site that will use the old system will be the legal page.
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:x-large;margin:4px;"><span>*</span> <span>*</span> <span>*</span></p>

## What will the *new system* involve.
On my new site I will be putting everything into obsidian and then pushing to GitHub. On GitHub there is a workflow that will turn the markdown pages for obsidian into a webpage. This uses [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) which is an amazing site generator for obsidian.

> **Using my website from Tor or a text based web browser?**
> You can still visit my site!
## What will happen next?
Over the coming weeks the main site will be updated to reflect this change.
