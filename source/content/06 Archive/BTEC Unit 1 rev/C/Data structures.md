# Data structures 
***
Data structures are a method of organising data in a formal structure.
## Types
### Array
Arrays are a static data structure that is fixed to a set size.

### Two dimensional arrays
Two dimensional arrays are an array with more than one array within it.
### Record
A record can store more than one data type.
### Lists
Are similar to records but are connected together.

### Sets
A set is like an array but only items of the same data type can be used and objects can not be repeated twice.
