## Abstract
> Improved photosynthesis can contribute to food security as population increases. Rubisco, a key target, can be manipulated to increase crop photosynthesis. Technological breakthroughs allow for higher plant Rubisco engineering, allowing for novel amino acid sequences. However, further efforts are needed to maintain grain quality and resistance to disease.
