## What is this site?

This site contains all my notes, tutorials, and other stuff that I find interesting. Think of this place as a mega wiki of all the things I find interesting and currently learning/researching. This site is a merge of my old blog, wiki and obsidian vaults into one place. This new site is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. You can learn more about this vault on this page: [What is this vault?](What%20is%20this%20vault?.md). 

<div class="X42-card-container">
<p>Open source</p><p>All in Markdown (and HTML)</p><p>All free content (CC BY-SA 4.0)</p></div>

## Where to start?
I recommend starting in the `01 Areas` folder since that has most of the content. Or use a map at [[00 Maps/index|this page]].
