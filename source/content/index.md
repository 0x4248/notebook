## What is this site?
*[[Индекс|Русский?]]*
This site contains all my notes, tutorials, and other stuff that I find interesting. Think of this place as a mega wiki of all the things I find interesting and currently learning/researching. In short this is my digital garden or vault. 
This vault is a collection of my notes, ideas, and resources that I have gathered over the years. It is a place where I can store my thoughts and ideas, and share them with others. The vault is designed to be a living document that evolves over time as I learn and grow.
This site is a merge of my old blog, wiki and obsidian vaults into one place. This new site is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. You can learn more about this vault on this page: [What is this vault?](What%20is%20this%20vault?.md).

This vault looks *way* better in obsidian, ~~but I have made the configs private~~ (Partially public now most of the configs are there just not plugins and plugin data. *There kinda massive*) so opening it on the website looks 80% accurate. If there are problems such as incorrect colours and images looking off, please don't hesitate and submit a issue. This vault also has a option for light mode if you really want to singe your eyes, just note that some of the images may look off since this vault is designed for dark mode. The vault in obsidian does have coloured pages but this doesn't show on the website, although I could add this it would take a lot of time and effort to do so (page theming in general just looks better in obsidian anyways). This vault also uses quite a bit of LaTeX so if you can see this $\LaTeX \space \Delta \space \Pi \space \Theta$ showing the LaTeX logo and Delta, Pi and Theta, then congrats you have a browser/obsidian that supports it!

On the website there is a sidebar with the pages and on the right there is the date it was created, tags, a graph and a table of contents to help you navigate the longer notes. Some notes are quite long and some are just a few sentences (It really depends on the note and how much I have written it).  
## How is it structured?
This is quite hard to explain since the folder system uses different systems like the Zettelkasten system and the Para system but here is a basic overview of the structure:
- Maps - Maps of content
- Areas - The main area separated into *areas* of interest
- Fleeting - Quick notes and snippets of things like stack overflow answers e.g [[Superscript in LaTeX]].
- Projects - Projects I am working on or have worked on (quite empty)
- Archive - Old notes or notes from other vaults
- Papers - Research papers, preprints and other documents that I have read or plan to read. Each paper has its own note with metadata and summaries, and notes I have made on the topics covered in the paper.
- Meta - Meta notes about this vault and how it works
- Private - Non public notes or notes that are not copyright free and therefore cant be published. Don't worry I don't store my super secret stuff here! Using obsidian for that in general wouldn't be a good idea either.


## Changelog and updates
Check out the #Daily tag for notes made on a daily basis. In this vault daily notes are not going to be my personal daily planner, think of it more as a git log tracking major changed and new files.

## Tagging system
This vault works with a [[Tags|tagging system]]. This is to ensure that each page is categorised.

Some tags may be put into a "sub" tag like #computer_science/2 so that it is more specific. It also looks way better on the graph.
