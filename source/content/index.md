## What is this site?

This site contains all my notes, tutorials, and other stuff that I find interesting. Think of this place as a mega wiki of all the things I find interesting and currently learning/researching. This site is a merge of my old blog, wiki and obsidian vaults into one place. This new site is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. You can learn more about this vault on this page: [What is this vault?](What%20is%20this%20vault?.md). 

## Want to view this better?

If you want to see my notes in a more user-friendly way, you can use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
