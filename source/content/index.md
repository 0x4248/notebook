## What is this site?

This site contains all my notes, tutorials, and other stuff that I find interesting. Think of this place as a mega wiki of all the things I find interesting and currently learning/researching. In short this is my digital garden or vault. 

This site is a merge of my old blog, wiki and obsidian vaults into one place. This new site is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. You can learn more about this vault on this page: [What is this vault?](What%20is%20this%20vault?.md).

> Since this is a new vault as of 01-01-2025, it is still under construction. Please check back later for more content.

## Where to start?
I recommend starting in the `01 Areas` folder since that has most of the content. Or use a map at [[00 Maps/index|this page]]. Here are some also quick links to main pages: [[Computer Science topics]], [[01 Areas/Languages/index|Languages]], [[03 Projects/index|Projects]]
