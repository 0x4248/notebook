# DAILY NOTE
<h2 style="text-align:center;">16-06-2025</h2>

***

## Changes today
- Added [[Expanding brackets]]
- Modified some of the css themes for obsidian and the site. 
- Fixed images not centring on the website.

Im thinking of changing the colours in obsidian again or even adding it to the website itself. And I might even put my `.obsidian` back onto GitHub so people can see how I have it set up, but again this comes with large amount of git changes. Maybe I could just add `.gitignore` to the files obsidian changes on a daily basis. *I'm just waffling now XD*
