# Midpoints and perpendicular bisectors

***
## Finding the midpoint
You can find the midpoint of a line by averaging the *x* and *y* coordinates of the endpoints.
$$
\begin{aligned}
A = (x_1, y_1) \\
B= (x_2, y_2) \\
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
For example we can find the midpoint of $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 4)$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
A = (1, 2) \\
B = (3, 4) \\
\left( \frac{1 + 3}{2}, \frac{2 + 4}{2} \right) = (2, 3)
\end{aligned}
$$
### Midpoint of a circle diameter
The midpoint of a circle's diameter is the centre of the circle. If you have two endpoints of the diameter, you can use the same formula as above to find the centre. In this example were going to show a simple sketch:

![[Circle midpoint from segment.excalidraw.svg]]

In the segment drawn on the circle, the endpoints are $A(-4, 8)$ and $B(4, 4)$. The midpoint is the centre of the circle, which is $(1, 6)$. The workings for this would look like this:
$$
\begin{aligned}
A = (-4, 8) \\
B = (4, 4) \\
\left( \frac{-4 + 4}{2}, \frac{8 + 4}{2} \right) = (0, 6)
\end{aligned}
$$
