# Xeno

## About Xeno

Xeno is a anthropomorphic wolf which is my secondary fursona. Xeno was my first ever fursona and has been replaced with [[Blix]]. I don't know how I got the name it just came to my mind one day. For some reason when I think of the name Xeno I think of the intel Xeon processors, lol. There isn't much art of Xeno but I might make some more in the future. Xeno does however have a ref sheet.

## Ref sheet

Here is Xeno's ref sheet:
