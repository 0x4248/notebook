# Learning Russian - Intro

***
What is this section? Well this is my log of me learning basic Russian because I think it would be a useful tool for me and plus half of Europe speaks similar [[Languages folder|languages]].

This is not a complete guide, these are just my notes I have made about the learning process, and it is not going to be in depth.
