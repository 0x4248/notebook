# Languages folder

***

I always have had a interest in languages and alphabets that are different from the Latin alphabet. In this folder contain notes I have made about different languages and their alphabets. I am mainly interested in Cyrillic and Greek languages, but I also have interests in other languages such as Japanese and Korean.

Before reading this section you might encounter some problems with rendering the text. Hopefully Noto Sans should be able to render most of the characters.

## Render test

Here is some render tests for different writing systems (Russian, Greek, Japanese, and Korean):

<p style="font-size:xx-large;text-align:center;margin:0;">Тест шрифта</p>

<p style="font-size:xx-large;text-align:center;margin:0;">Δοκιμή γραμματοσειράς</p>

<p style="font-size:xx-large;text-align:center;margin:0;">フォントテスト</p>

<p style="font-size:xx-large;text-align:center;margin:0;">글꼴 테스트</p>
