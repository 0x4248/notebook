## Dropped letters
Over the language certain letters were replaced with new letters such as letters that reduced readability. These include some [[Greek alphabet]] letters and old Cyrillic letters. Most of the alphabet uses the [[Russian alphabet]] and a few [[Greek alphabet]] letters.

## Dropped diacritics
Aurlian used to have diacritics to merge one letter with another. Below is an example:

These were called letter extensions and were used to merge two letters into one. These were dropped due to problems with readability on certain fonts especially with greek letters.
