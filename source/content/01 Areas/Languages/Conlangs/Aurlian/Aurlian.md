# Aurlian
<p style="font-size:xx-large;text-align:center;margin:0;font-family:sanserif;">Ачрлиан</p>

***
Aurlian is the first conlang that I made and uses [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Russian alphabet|Cyrillic]] and Latin letters.

Over its development time Aurlian went trough several changes to its alphabet and how its written. At one point it had a stacked letter system.

This system has since been dropped due to problems with readability on certain fonts.
