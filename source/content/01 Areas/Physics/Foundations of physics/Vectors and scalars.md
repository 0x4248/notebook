# Vectors and scalars

***
## Scalar quantities
Scalar quantities are those that have only a magnitude (size) and no direction. A good example of this is temperature.

## Vector quantities
Vector quantities are those that have both a magnitude and a direction. Examples of vector quantities include velocity, force, and displacement. A vector would be shown with an arrow pointing in the direction of the vector.

### Adding vectors
When two vectors are in force they must be added to get the resultant force on an object.

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= 2.0N \\
B &= 4.0N \\
\text{Resultant vector} = A + B &= 6.0N 
\end{aligned}
$$
