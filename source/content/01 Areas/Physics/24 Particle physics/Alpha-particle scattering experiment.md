# Alpha-particle scattering experiment

***
The alpha particle scattering experiment, also known as Rutherford's gold foil experiment, was a groundbreaking experiment conducted by Ernest Rutherford in 1909. It provided crucial evidence for the nuclear model of the atom.

In this experiment two things were noticed:
- Most [[Alpha, Beta and Gamma|alpha]] particles passed right trough the foil without any reflection but were slightly scattered by the gold atoms (1 in 2000)
- Very few particles (1 in 10,000) were deflected.
