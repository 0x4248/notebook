# Physics

***

Again like with [[Maths]], I don't take physics as a subject in college but I like learning about it in my free time.

## Contents
- **1**: Foundations of physics
    - [[Units in physics]]
    - [[Vectors and scalars]]
- **2**: Motion
    - [[Distance and speed]]
    - [[Acceleration]]
- **08**: Charge and current
    - [[Charge and current]]
- **24**: Particle physics
    - [[Alpha-particle scattering experiment]]
## Physics papers
I like to read some [[Physics papers|physics preprints]] on arXiv. Here are some examples
- [[A Beginner's Guide to Working with Astronomical Data]]
- [[X-ray equipment operation]]
- [[A brief introduction to quantum algorithms]]
- [[Exoplanet Detection - A Detailed Analysis]]
