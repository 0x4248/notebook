## Abstract

> This elementary review covers the basics of working with astronomical data, notably with images, spectra and higher-level (catalog) data. The basic concepts and tools are presented using both application software (DS9 and TOPCAT) and Python. The level of presentation is suitable for undergraduate students, but should also be accessible to advanced high school students.

## Notes on this paper
### Key types of data when working with astronomical data
- **Images**: This is the most common type of data in astronomy and is "a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel value denotes a brightness value"
