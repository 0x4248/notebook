# Physics papers

***
## What is this folder about?
This folder contains my collection of physics research papers, preprints, and other documents that I've read or plan to read. Each paper has its own note with metadata and summaries, structured for easy linking and future retrieval.

The notes are designed to work well with Obsidian's upcoming `BOOK` file format (currently in beta), making them ready for future publishing or export.
