## Abstract
> Quantum algorithms are demonstrated to outperform classical algorithms for certain problems and thus are promising candidates for efficient information processing. Herein we aim to provide a brief and popular introduction to quantum algorithms for both the academic community and the general public with interest. We start from elucidating quantum parallelism, the basic framework of quantum algorithms and the difficulty of quantum algorithm design. Then we mainly focus on a historical overview of progress in quantum algorithm research over the past three to four decades. Finally, we clarify two common questions about the study of quantum algorithms, hoping to stimulate readers for further exploration.
