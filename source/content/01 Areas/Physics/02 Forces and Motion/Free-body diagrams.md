# Free-body diagrams

***

To analyse the forces acting on an object we can draw a free-body diagram. This is basically a labelled diagram with [[Vectors and scalars|vectors]].

## Primary forces that can be used in a free body diagram

| Name                                               | Notes                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Force, mass and weight#Mass and weight\|Weight]] | Gravity acting on an object trough its [[Centre of mass]] |
| Friction                                           | The force when two object rub against each other          |
| Drag                                               | The force from resitance created by air and liquid        |
| Tension                                            | The force within a rope that is tightened                 |
| Upthrust                                           | The force from buoyancy acting on a object in fluid       |
| [[Normal contact force]]                           | The force when once object rests on another               |
## Showing forces
- Each force vector is represented by an arrow with a label showing its force
- The longer the arrow the stronger the force
