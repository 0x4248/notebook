# Distance and speed

***
## Average speed
The average speed of a moving object can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Average speed} &= \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \\
v &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

> **Note:**
>
> The greek delta ($\Delta$) symbol is used to represent change in.

## Distance time graphs
Graphs can be used to represent the motion of object.
- **Distance** is plotted on the *y* axis. (Vertical)
- **Time** is plotted on the *x* axis. (Horizontal)
- The speed is equal to the gradient of the graph
- A horizontal line indicates that the object is stationary.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Distance change}\space\Delta x &= 1200 - 600 = 600m \\
\text{Time change}\space\Delta t &= 60 - 30 = 30s \\
v = \frac{600}{30} &= 20ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Displacement time graphs
Graphs of displacement are to show how an object is displaced over time.
- Displacement is plotted on the *y*-axis
- Time is plotted on the *x*-axis

## Varying speed and displacement
Naturally object do not instantly gain speed, and will have a period of time where the object is speeding up and accelerating.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Speed equation:}\\
v &= \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} \\
\text{Example values given below:} \\
\Delta d &= 300 \\
\Delta t &= 60 \\
v = \frac{300}{60} &= 5 ms^{-1} 
\end{aligned}
$$
