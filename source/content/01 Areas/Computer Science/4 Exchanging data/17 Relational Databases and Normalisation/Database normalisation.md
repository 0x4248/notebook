# Normalisation
***
Normalisation is the process used to make the best possible design for a relational database.
- No data is duplicated without a reason
- Data is consistent throughout
- The structure of the database should be flexible so the user can add as little or as many amount of data to the database
- The database should allow all kinds of data queries done to the database.
## First normal form
A database is in its first normal form if it doesn't contain any repeating attribute.
