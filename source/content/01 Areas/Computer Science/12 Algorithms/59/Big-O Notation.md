# Big-O Notation

***
**Big O** notation is a way of comparing algorithms using a formula to annotate the efficiency.
Logarithmic time
Big-O allows you to see the time complexity of algorithms.

| Formula  | Relative to      |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| O(1)     | Constant time    |
| O(n)     | Linear time      |
| O(n^2)   | Polynomial time  |
| O(2^n)   | Exponential time |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic time |
