# Graph Traversal Algorithms

***
There are two ways to traverse in a graph in order to meet each node, which are:
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Uses a stack.
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Uses a queue.

## Depth First Search (DFS)
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.
