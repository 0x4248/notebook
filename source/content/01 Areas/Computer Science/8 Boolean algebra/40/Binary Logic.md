# Binary Logic

***
Since computers can only understand [[Binary|binary]] which means they can only do operations in 1s and 0s. Logic gates can help with doing these operations and are the building blocks of computers.

## Logic gates
There are a number of different 
Logic gates take in one or more input and produce a single output.
### NOT
A not gate inverts an input. On a gate the small circle represents an inverted input.

| Input A | Output |
| ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 0      |

### AND
An and gate checks if input A *and* B are true. If they are both true the output is true.

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 0      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |
