# IP Addresses

***
An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. It is used to route data to the correct device on a network. There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the most common type of IP address and is a 32-bit address. IPv6 is a newer type of IP address and is a 128-bit address.
