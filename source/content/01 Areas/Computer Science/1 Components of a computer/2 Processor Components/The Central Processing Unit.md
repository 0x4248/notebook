# The Central Processing Unit
***
The CPU is the main processor in a computer.

## Key components
### Control unit
The control unit controls all the activities that are done within the CPU.
### Buses
A bus is the wires that connect the components of the computer to the CPU and is also used within the CPU to content other parts of the CPU together.

A bus commonly comes in 8, 16, 32 or 64 lines and can be split into three types:
- Data bus 
- Address bus
- Control bus
#### Data
A data bus transports data between the CPU and memory.
#### Control bus
The control bus transports instructions between the CPU and memory. These include program instructions and signals sent from the control unit.
#### Address bus
The address bus transports memory addresses between the CPU and memory.
