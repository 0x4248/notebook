# Harvard Architecture
<p class="text-center" style="margin:0;color:gray;">Processor type</p>

***
The Harvard architecture physically separates the busses into data and instructions. Harvard architecture can be faster than von neumann due to the fact that one bus cant contain two types of data.

| Used in most computers                      | Used in digital signal processing and in embedded systems |
| Data and instructions share the same memory | Data and instructions are held in separate memory.        |
| One bus is used                             | Separate busses are used                                  |
| Programs can be optimised                   | Programs are larger                                       |
