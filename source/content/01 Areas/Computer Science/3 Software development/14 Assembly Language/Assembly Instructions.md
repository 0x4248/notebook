# Assembly Instructions

***

In order for programs to be turned into machine code they must be written in assembly language or at least be converted into assembly language. Assembly language is the lowest programming language.

| Instruction (Mnemonic code) | Explanation                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ADD`                       | Add the current item in the accumulator with the address defined       |
| `SUB`                       | Subtract the current item in the accumulator with ther address defined |
| `STA`                       | Store the current item in the accumulator into memory                  |
| `LDA`                       | Load from memory                                                       |
| `BRA`                       | Branch always                                                          |
| `BRZ`                       | Branch if the accumulator is zero                                      |
| `BRP`                       | Branch if the accumulator is positive                                  |
| `INP`                       | Take in a input and store into the accumilator                         |
| `OUT`                       | Print out the current state of the accumulator                         |
| `HLT`                       | End the program                                                        |
| `DAT`                       | Data location                                                          |
- Each instruction is 3 letters long 
- There are 11 instructions in total
