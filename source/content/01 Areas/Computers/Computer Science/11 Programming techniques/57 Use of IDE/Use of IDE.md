# Use of IDE
***
An **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE) is a [[Utility Programs|program]] which makes it easter for developers to develop and debug software.
## Examples
- Visual Studio Code
- InteliJ
## Common features
Many IDE's come with these features:
- Runtime stepping
    - **Allows the developer to step trough the code line by line** which can help identify where bugs are happening in the code. It can also help the developer understand what the code is doing what it is doing.
- Variable watching
    - Many IDE's **allow for variables to be watched** which can help the developer understand what is happening to the variables. This is often used with runtime stepping (*above*).
- Breakpoints
    - **Breakpoints allow the developer to pause the code at a specific point**, this can help pinpoint where an error is happening. 
- Source code editors
    - Almost every IDE comes with a source code editor or a text editor of some kind **to allow the developer edit the program code**. Many of these editors come with features including:
        - **Syntax highlighting** - Syntax highlighting highlights a specific syntax in a different colour to make it easier to read.
        - **Autocompletion** - This feature allows the developer to autocomplete the word or entire line that they are typing in order to speed up the development process.
        - **Automatic indentation** - Indentation allows the code to be kept neat and tidy.
- Debugging tools
    - **Debugging tools help the developer find and fix bugs in the code**. This can include breakpoints, runtime stepping and variable watching (*which are mentioned above*) as well as other tools.
