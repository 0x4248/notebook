# Aspects of software development
***
## Overview
- **Analysis**: Before the problem can be solved, the requirements  of the new system must be gathered.
- **Design**: In the design phase key components of the project are designed and the overall structure of the project is planned.
- **Development**: In this stage the solution is developed.
- **Testing**: In this stage the developed software is tested and any bugs are fixed.
- **Implementation**: In this stage the last development stage is carried out and final testing is done.
- **Evaluation**: In this stage the software is evaluated and a post-implement review is carried out.
### Analysis
The analysis stage is first stage of the software development cycle. In this stage the requirements and constraints of the new system are gathered.
### Design
This stage is the planning of the project and designing the new system. In this stage the following is designed:
- processing
- [[Data structures]]
- outputs
- inputs
- user interface
- hardware
### Testing
This stage is the testing of the software and fixing any bugs that are found.
#### Black box testing
Black box testing is testing that tests if the inputs and outputs of the program are expected.
#### Alpha testing
Alpha testing focuses on the checking the structure of the code.
