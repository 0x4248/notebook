# C64 LOAD

***
To load a program on the Commodore 64, you would use the `LOAD` command. This command is used to load a program from a storage device like a disk or tape. The `LOAD` command is followed by the name of the program you want to load.
- `LOAD "*"` - Loads the first program found on the tape.
- `LOAD "PROGRAM"` - Loads the program named "PROGRAM".
- `LOAD "$",8` - Loads the first program found on the disk.
