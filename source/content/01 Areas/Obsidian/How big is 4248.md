# How big is 4248

***
So as you know by now (if you have been looking around on my site for a while) you know that 0x4248 or 4248 is my personal brand name. 4248 isn't like Nike, Apple or Google, its simply me. Some people raise the question, how big is 4248? And to answer that,  *I don't know*. There is over five years of content sitting on the internet and hours of media that its almost impossible to track how long, just alone on the IPTV television broadcasts there has been 2191 hours of content. I also take loads of images, over 10,000. Most of these are not on the internet but are instead stored on physical hard drives.
