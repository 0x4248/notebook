# Alpha, Beta and Gamma

***
In physics there are three main types of radioactive particles. These are alpha, beta, and gamma particles. They are emitted by unstable atomic nuclei during radioactive decay. Ernest Rutherford identified the alpha and beta particles and Paul Villard discovered gamma rays.

## Specification of the particles
| Particle | Charge | Symbol                       |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Alpha    | +2     | $\alpha$ or $^4_2\text{He}$  |
| Beta     | -1     | $\beta$ or $^0_{-1}\text{e}$ |
| Gamma    | 0      | $\gamma$                     |
|          |        |                              |
## Penetration of the particles
Each type has its own penetration power:
- **Alpha**: A sheet of paper or a few cm of air.
- **Beta**: A few mm of aluminium.
- **Gamma**: Several cm of lead or several m of concrete.
