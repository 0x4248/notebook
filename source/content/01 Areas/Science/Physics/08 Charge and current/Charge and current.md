# Charge and current

***

Electric current is measured in amperes (A) and is one of the [[Units in physics#SI base units|SI base units]]. Electric current is defined as the rate of flow or charge and can be defined using this equation:
$$
\begin{aligned}
I &= \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} \\
I &= \text{Amps} \\
\Delta Q &= \text{Charge transferred in coulombs} \\
\Delta t &= \text{Time in seconds} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
