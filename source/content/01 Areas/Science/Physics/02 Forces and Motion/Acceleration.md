# Acceleration

***
## Basic concepts
**Acceleration** is the rate of change in velocity. In the equation below $a$ is the velocity.

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\
\Delta v &= \text{Change in velocity} \\
\Delta t &= \text{Change in time} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Acceleration can be positive or negative, depending on whether the object is speeding up or slowing down.

### Example
Lets say a object goes from 0 m/s to 20 m/s in 5 seconds, we can calculate the acceleration as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta v &= 20 - 0 = 20 \text{ m/s} \\
\Delta t &= 5 \text{ s} \\
a &= \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ m/s}^2
\end{aligned}
$$

## Acceleration on time graphs
On a time graph acceleration would be written as $\text{acceleration} = \text{gradient of velocity} - \text{time graph}$ and is not much different from [[Distance and speed#Distance time graphs|this distance time graph]]
