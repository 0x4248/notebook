The mass of an object is a physical property that depends on the amount of matter it contains. A resultant (also known as net) force acting on the object will make it move and accelerate in the direction that the force is applied in. The resultant force can be calculated using the following:

$$
F = ma
$$
- $F$ = Force
- $m$ = Mass
- $a$ = Acceleration
*For notes on acceleration see: [[Acceleration|this page]]*

## Mass and weight
In physics weight and mass are two separate meanings. Mass refers to the weight of the object and is constant ($kg$) and weight is dependent on where it is since gravity will make an object seem heaver or lighter ($N (kgms^{-2})$)
