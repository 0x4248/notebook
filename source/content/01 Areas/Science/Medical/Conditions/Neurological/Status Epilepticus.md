# Status Epilepticus

***
A **Status Epilepticus** (SE) is a prolonged [[Seizure|seizure]] lasting more than 5 minutes or multiple seizures without full recovery in between. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent long-term neurological damage or death. SE can be convulsive or non-convulsive, with the former involving violent muscle contractions and the latter being less obvious, often characterized by altered consciousness or behavior.
## Risk factors
SE can happen to anyone but it is more likely to happen with:
- Males
- Children
- Elderly
- People with a history of epilepsy or [[Seizures]]

Treatment for SE typically involves:
- **Benzodiazepines**: Medications like lorazepam or diazepam are often used as first-line treatments.
- **Phenytoin or Fosphenytoin**: These are used to stabilize the electrical activity in the brain and were used as the first line of treatment in the past.
