# Asthma

***
**Asthma** is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty in breathing. It can cause wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma symptoms can vary in severity and may be triggered by allergens, exercise, cold air, or respiratory infections.

## Symptoms
Common symptoms of asthma include:
- Wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing)
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness or pain
- Coughing

## Asthma attacks
Serious asthma attacks can lead to:
- Severe shortness of breath
- Inability to speak in full sentences
- Rapid breathing
- Use of accessory muscles for breathing (such as neck and chest muscles)
Ambulances or immediate treatment is required if these symptoms occur to prevent complications.

## Treatments
Asthma is typically managed with a combination of medications and lifestyle changes:
- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: These are the most common long-term control medications that reduce inflammation in the airways.
- **Reducing exposure to triggers**: Identifying and avoiding allergens or irritants that can worsen asthma symptoms.
- **Quick-relief inhalers**: Also known as rescue inhalers, these medications provide rapid relief from acute asthma symptoms.
    - [[Salbutamol]]  a common quick-relief inhaler.
