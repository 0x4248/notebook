# Bradycardia

***

**Bradycardia** is where the heart rate is below 60 beats per minute when at rest. It can be a normal finding in athletes or during sleep (sometimes 40-50 bpm particularly when in deeper sleep stages), but in other cases it can indicate an underlying health condition.

## Symptoms
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fainting or near-fainting spells
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Confusion or memory problems

Since the heart rate is lower than normal the brain revives less oxygen hence why patients often experience symptoms like dizziness and fatigue. 

## Treatments
Untreated bradycardia can lead to complications such as heart failure, cardiac arrest, or even death if serious enough. Treatment may include:
- Pacemaker
- [[Atropine]] (a medication that increases heart rate)
- Adjusting medications that may be causing bradycardia
