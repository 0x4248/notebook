# Bletchley Park

**Bletchley Park** is a historic site in the UK, known for its role during [[World War II]] as the central site for British codebreakers. It was where the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers were decrypted, significantly contributing to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort.

## Hut 8
Many of the codebreakers worked in various huts at Bletchley Park, each designated for different tasks. Hut 8 was where Alan Turing's office was located. Alan Turing was a key figure in the development of early computers and played a pivotal role in breaking the Enigma code.
