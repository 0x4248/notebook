# Commodore 64

***
Here are my notes on the C64 system. Most of the information here is provided from the original manual. Which can be found [here on the internet archive](https://archive.org/details/commodore-64-user-guide/).

Now since I don't have a C64 with me I am using an emulator called VICE[^1].
