# C64 POKE hacks

***
Here I list some interesting POKE hacks for the Commodore 64. Back in the 70s and 80s, magazines would publish a section of poke commands that you can try out on your C64 to get some interesting effects. 

| POKE number | Param | Effect                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 775         | 220   | Disables the list function from listing any values. Putting `167` into the same poke enables the function. |
| 649         | 0     | Turns off keyboard input, entering `10` enables it again.                                                  |
