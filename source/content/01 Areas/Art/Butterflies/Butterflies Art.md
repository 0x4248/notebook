# Butterflies Art
***
Since I have an interest in butterflies, I did some artwork using photos from a butterfly museum I went to. I quite like digital and watercolour art, so I did a few different versions of the same piece.

## Watercolour

## Watercolour and digital
For this one I took my watercolour work, scanned them in and used Photoshop to turn them into a collage.

## Paper
I printed out the images I took and then used layering on this.

## Digital
This collage uses images that I took.
