# What is DPX

***
The Design Proposal Exchange (DPX for short) is a online format for planning and publishing designs, protocols, standards and other technical documents in a open source format. Each design is given a unique identifier which looks something like this: `DPX25-584694`. It is structured as `DPX{YY}-{RANDOM 6 NUMBERS}` this allows for one million unique documents per year. If one million document pass or a number is taken a letter can be put next to the year like this `DPX25H-593349` any letter from A-Z can be used. Each of these deisgns are called a record.
## What must a record contain?
Each record should have the following metadata:
- The ID
- Date
- Authors
- Title
- A description
- Copyrights
- License
- Usage rights

This can be stored in a text file or in a PDF but must be easily seen. A record must also contain a file (not including the metadata) of these types:
- A TXT file of the design documentation
- A Markdown file of the design
- A PDF
- A archive containing anything relating to the record in these formats:
    - ZIP
    - TAR
    - TAR GZ
This makes it so records are not empty and have a use.
## Licensing
Record can have any licence and usage rights, but a free and open source licence is preferred such as Creative Commons or GNU General Public License 3.0.
### Usage rights
If you prefer to have a custom licence you can put set usage rights such as commercial use or adaptation rights.
