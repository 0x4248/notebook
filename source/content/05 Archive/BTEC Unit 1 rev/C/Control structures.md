# Control structures 
***
Algorithms are built on three main control structures
1. Sequence
2. Selection
3. Iteration
## Main control structures
### Sequence
Sequence is where one action is done after another action.
### Selection
Selection is where certain actions are ran only if a condition is met.
### Iteration
Iteration is where certain actions are completed one after another.
## Loops
Loops allow the program to loop over actions in the program either infinitely or with a set amount of loops. 
## Branches
Branches are where the code makes a decision based off an condition and decides whether or not to run a section of code.
