# Your first ARM Assembly Program

***

This is a simple guide to writing your first ARM assembly program for linux. This guide will show you how to write a simple program that will print `Hello World` to the console.

## Installing required packages

You will need to install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

These packages are required to compile the program.

## Writing the program

Open a text editor like `vim` or `nano` and create a new file called `hello.s`:

```bash
nano hello.s
```

Or if you prefer `vim`:

```bash
vim hello.s
```

This should put you in a text editor. Copy the following into it:

```assembly
.section .data
    msg:
        .ascii "Hello world\n"
        len = . - msg

.section .text
    .globl _start

_start:
    mov x0, 1
    ldr x1, =msg
    ldr x2, =len
    mov x8, 64
    svc 0
    mov x8, 93
    mov x0, 0
    svc 0
```

Then save the file.

## Compiling the program

To compile our program we are going to use `as` ans `ld`. Run the following commands:

```bash
as -o hello.o hello.s
ld -o hello hello.o
```

This will create an executable called `hello`.

## Running the program

To run the program, simply run:

```bash
./hello
```

You should see `Hello world` printed to the console.

## Explanation

The program is divided into two sections: `.data` and `.text`. The `.data` section contains the string `Hello world\n` and the length of the string. The `.text` section contains the `_start` label which is the entry point of the program.

```assembly
.section .data
    msg:
        .ascii "Hello world\n"
        len = . - msg
```

The `_start` label is the entry point of the program. and it is defined as a global symbol using the `.globl` directive.

```assembly
.section .text
    .globl _start
```

In the `_start` section, we have the program instructions.

```assembly
_start:
    mov x0, 1       // Set the file descriptor for stdout
    ldr x1, =msg    // Load the address of the message into x1 (parameter 1 for stdout)
    ldr x2, =len    // Load the length of the message into x2  (parameter 2 for stdout)
    mov x8, 64      // Set the syscall number for write
    svc 0           // Call the kernel
    mov x8, 93      // Set the syscall number for exit
    mov x0, 0       // Set the exit status (0 for success)
    svc 0           // Call the kernel
```
