# Legal information

***
This page contains legal information about my notes.

## Content licence
Here is a basic run down with how you can use most of my notes on this site:

>[!check]- Personal use

>[!success]- Commercial use (with conditions)
> Only if the content is under CC BY-SA 4.0

>[!check]- Share
> Copying of content is allowed as long as you give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license or original source, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

>[!check]- Adapt and modify
> You can remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

>[!check]- No platform restrictions
> Use this content anywhere regardless of the platform.

>[!fail]- Changing of license
> Changing the licence or copyright/attribution is not allowed. You must keep the same licence and attribution as the original.

>[!fail]- Not following terms of service
> You may not use the material in a way that violates the terms of service of the platform you are using it on. This includes using content for:
> - Hate speech
> - Harassment
> - Violence
> - Illegal activities
> - Adult content (See note)
>   
> ## About Adult content
> 
> With the above statement saying "No platform restrictions", this does not mean if a site contains 18+ content it is allowed to be posted there. It means it cant be included in content that contains 18+ content. For example using my image in a adult video is not allowed.

>[!warning]- Other licenses may be used on this site
> Be aware that some content may be under a different attribution or licence. Please see the captions, footnotes and any warning banners on the page before using content.

>[!warning]- Other copyright aliases
> Since my personal site is quite large, I may have content that is under different copyright or attribution. For example:
> - 0x4248
> - 4248 Media
> - 4248 Systems
> - 4248 Sound Recordings
> 
> 
> If you are unsure you can use **0x4248** and **4248 Media** for images.
