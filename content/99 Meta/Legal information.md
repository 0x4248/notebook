# Legal information

*I believe the internet should be free and open to everyone. Which is why:*

>[!check]- No geo restrictions or censorship
> Unless government laws have locked content in a region which is out of my control.
> 
> I have not put any geo locks on purpose

>[!check]- No paywalls 

>[!check]- Free content for everyone using CC and OS licenses
