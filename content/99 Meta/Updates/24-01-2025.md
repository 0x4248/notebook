# Update: 24-01-2025
<p class="text-center" style="margin:0;opacity:0.6;">Important updates to how files are sorted </p>

***
In order to make files in this vault more accessible and easier to find using obsidian features like graph and search, changes to the way that I use [[File properties]] has changed.

## What has changed?
Files should have proper tags such as language used and aliases that makes it easier to find. Each file also now has a version which is the version of the [[File properties]] that I use.

### Other changes to git
The `.obsidan` folder has been removed from the git repository. This is because it is very large.
