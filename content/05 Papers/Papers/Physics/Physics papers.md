# Physics papers

***
## What is this folder about?
This folder contains my collection of physics research papers, preprints, and other documents that I've read or plan to read. Each paper has its own note with metadata and summaries, structured for easy linking and future retrieval.

The notes are designed to work well with Obsidian's upcoming `BOOK` file format (currently in beta), making them ready for future publishing or export. 

The `PDF` papers are not included in this vault but HTTP links to the PDF files are provided in the notes. **Why?** Many of these papers have copyright protection or are locked behind a paywall but some sites like arXiv allow you to download/view the PDF files freely.
## Example pages
- [[A Beginner's Guide to Working with Astronomical Data]]
- [[X-ray Techniques - Overview]]
