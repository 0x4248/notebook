## Specification
The PDF record design is a specification for how to write PDF's for DPX records. This makes sure that all records that use PDF follow the same structure and format. This makes it easier for people to read and understand the PDF's.

### Structure
The PDF should have the following structure:
1. **Title Page**: The first page should contain the title with the record ID as a subtitle below that
2. **Metadata table**: The first page also has a table that looks like this:

On one side have the following
```
ID: DPX25-494811
DATE: 24/05/2025
AUTHORS:
• NAME
• NAME
• NAME
COPYRIGHTS:
© 2025 NAME
```

On the other side place the description.
3. **Contents page**: The very next page should have a table of contents.
4. **Optional license page**: If the record has a license, it should be placed here, this is optional since some licenses are long. If this is not possible then the license name can be placed at the bottom of the metadata table.
5. **Main content**: The rest of the PDF should contain the main content of the record. This can be anything that is relevant to the record.

### Font
The font used in the PDF should be a serif or sans-serif font. Some reccomended fonts are:
- Georgia - Serif
- Lexend - Sans-serif
- Roboto - Sans-serif
- Libretron-Serif - Serif
- Libretron-Mono - Monospace
- Jetbrains Mono - Monospace
### Images
Images in the PDF should be placed in the main content and should be relevant to the record. Images can be captioned with a figure ID.
### Cover page
An additional cover design can be added to the PDF. This can be an image or a design that is relevant to the record. The cover page should have the record ID and title on it.
