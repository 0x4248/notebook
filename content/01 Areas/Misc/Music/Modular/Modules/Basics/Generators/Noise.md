## Types
- **White Noise**: Equal intensity across all frequencies.
- **Pink Noise**: Equal intensity per octave, reducing high-frequency noise.
- **Brown Noise**: More energy at lower frequencies, resembling a deep rumble.
- **Blue Noise**: More energy at higher frequencies, often used in dithering.
- **Purple Noise**: Even more energy at higher frequencies than blue noise.
- **Gray Noise**: Equal energy per frequency, adjusted for human hearing sensitivity.
- **Black Noise**: Absence of sound, often used in audio testing.
