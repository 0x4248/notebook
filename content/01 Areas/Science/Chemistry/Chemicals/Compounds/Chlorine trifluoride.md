### Fire and Explosion Hazards
Chlorine trifluoride is an oxidiser and can cause or enhance the combustion of other materials. It is highly reactive and can ignite spontaneously in contact with organic materials.
### Health Hazards
- Liquid form contact with skin causes third degree burns.
- Severe lung irritation and damage can occur from inhalation.
- Death can occur from inhalation of high concentrations.
