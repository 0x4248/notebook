# Units in physics

***

In physics there are lots of units. In physics a **quantity** is a property of an object. For example length and mass are quantities.

## SI base units
SI base units are designed to standardise measurements across the world. It is used in not just physics but also medicine$^{\text{[Ref 4]}}$, engineering and many other fields. The SI base units are the fundamental units from which all other units are derived. Here are the seven SI base units:

| Quantity                  | Unit     | Symbol |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Length                    | metre    | m      |
| Mass                      | kilogram | kg     |
| Time                      | second   | s      |
| Electric current          | ampere   | A      |
| Thermodynamic temperature | kelvin   | K      |
| Amount of substance       | mole     | mol    |
| Luminous intensity        | candela  | cd     |
### Prefixes
Prefixes are used to denote multiples or fractions of a unit. Here are some common prefixes:

| Prefix | Symbol | Factor          |
| ------ | ------ | --------------- |
| tera   | T      | 10^12           |
| giga   | G      | 10^9            |
| mega   | M      | 10^6            |
| kilo   | k      | 10^3            |
| hecto  | h      | 10^2            |
| deca   | da     | 10^1            |
| deca   | da     | 10^1            |
| deci   | d      | 10^-1           |
| centi  | c      | 10^-2           |
| milli  | m      | 10^-3           |
| micro  | Î¼      | 10^-6           |
| nano   | n      | 10^-9           |
| pico   | p      | 10^-12          |
| femto  | f      | 10^-15          |
