# Development Models

***
There are many different development lifecycles that can be used to develop a system. Some of the most common ones are:
- [[#The Waterfall Cycle]]
- [[#Spiral Model]]
- [[#Agile Modeling]]
- [[#Extreme Programming]]

## The Waterfall Cycle
The Waterfall Cycle is a linear model that has the following stages:
- [[Aspects of software development#Analysis|Analysis]]
- [[Aspects of software development#Design|Design]]
- Implementation
- Evaluation
- Maintenance

## Spiral Model
The Spiral Model is a continuous model, meaning that the stages are repeated until the project is finished.

## Agile Modeling
Agile modeling is a model that is iterative and incremental. This means that the project is broken down into smaller parts and each part is developed in a series of iterations.

## Extreme Programming
Extreme programming is where the project is rapidly developed.
