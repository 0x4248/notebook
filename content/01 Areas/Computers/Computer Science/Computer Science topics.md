Here is a list of every topic that is covered on the A Level Computer Science. When you click a page you will be able to see the notes I have made for that topic.

**Why are so many crossed out?**

Well its because I simply, ran out of time. I don't have time to make notes about every nitty gritty detail of the course. So I have focused on the topics that I think are most important and will be most useful. Some pages are stubs which will be removed or filled out latter. 

**Was this the ONLY revision I did for my A Level?**

**No**, this isn't all of them. I look at past papers and mark schemes, I did past paper questions, I used other resources like textbooks and websites. This is just the notes I made based off the specification and the lessons I had at college etc.

Just before an exam (like a day or two) I like to flick trough past papers, just thinking of the answer in my head and seeing how close I was to the mark scheme. If I got it wrong look over it to refresh on the topic etc. This is like training that memory curve and helps me remember the topic and **key words** better. Just remember, revision isn't about learning everything, its about learning the key concepts and being able to apply them in the exam. Try and revise everything and you will forget the important stuff. But everyone is different, so do what works for **you**.
