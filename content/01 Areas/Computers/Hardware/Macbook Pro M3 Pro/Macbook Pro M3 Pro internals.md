## Disassembly guide
To take apart the MacBook you will need a tiny Penelope screwdriver, hand force and a suction cup (Not needed but helpful).
### Taking off the screws
Take off the screws ensuring you remember where each one goes to 
because they all have different sizes.
### Unclipping the case
Push on the case near the fan hole working from left to right. The case should click and shift.

>[!note]
> Pushing near the fan holes can help unclip the case 

### Taking the case poppers off
Pull up on the case using the suction cup a little to the left below the MacBook Pro logo and a little to the right to the logo. Then apply the same force next to the fan holes. You should hear a loud click or pop that sounds like something broke (its the popper coming out from the socket)

>[!danger] 
> Do not take off the case if you have not fully unclipped the case from the body

>[!tip] 
> Using your fingernail or a prying tool can help start to take the front poppers off but do not pull on the front too far as this could bend the case.
### Lifting off the case
Lift up the case from the front and pull towards you.
## Assembly guide
To reassemble the MacBook you have to use the screwdriver and slide the case in a specific way to lock the case back into the main frame of the laptop.
### Putting in the bottom case

Make sure the metal clips slide back into the laptop clip holders.
### Clicking the case back in
Apply pressure to the front of the case and work your way to the fan sides you should hear four loud clicks. These are the case poppers being put back in.
### Screwing the case back in.
Screw all the top 4 screws and bottom 4 screws back in place.

>[!danger] 
> You must put the screws back in place correctly since some screws are different sizes
