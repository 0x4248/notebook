# Hub two board identification

***
## Part number
On the back of the board there is a number with `P/N` next to it. This could possibly be referring to the part number. This number is `141951720036J`
## Front board numbers
On the front of the board next to the middle shield

From online sources `HSB J` appears to be the manufacture. The UL symbol (the one that looks like a backwards R with a U attached) is the Recognised Component Mark.

`94V-0`, `MV-4` and `E89382` appear on every board that I have seen with the `HSB J` mark. This could refer to a factory.

`2225` Is most likely the batch number and not the board identification number.
