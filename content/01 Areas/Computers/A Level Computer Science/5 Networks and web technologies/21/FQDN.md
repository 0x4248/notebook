# FQDN

***
A fully qualified domain name (FQDN)[^1] is basically a full domain name. This includes the top level domain, the second level domain, and any other subdomains. For example, in the domain name `www.example.com`, `www` is a subdomain, `example` is the second level domain, and `com` is the top level domain.
