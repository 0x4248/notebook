# Graphics Processing Unit

***
A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialised processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering. It is highly parallelised, allowing it to handle multiple operations simultaneously, which makes it particularly effective for rendering complex images and video.

A GPU is a form of a co-processor since it works with the CPU.
