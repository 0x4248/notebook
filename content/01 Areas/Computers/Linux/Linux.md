<p style="text-align:center;font-size:large;margin:0;opacity:0.5;">Linux and UNIX</p>

***
Welcome to the 0x4248 Linux/UNIX notebook, here I publish all my notes and tips on using Linux and UNIX systems almost like a man page. Hence also why you can get to here using `man.0x4248.dev`.

## Categories
Like with [[Man|man]] on linux, this is split into several sections:
- `0` Kernel and core - Notes relating to the linux kernel and other core systems like BIOS, UEFI and drivers.
- `1` System - System components ([[systemd]], [[udev]]) and system administration ([[systemctl]], [[journalctl]]).
- `2` Userland - Userland components like [[bash]], [[zsh]], [[fish]] and programs like [[vim]].
- `3` Fundamentals - Guides and other useful pages like [[Linux filesystem hierarchy]] and [[Linux file permissions]].
- `4` Networking - Networking tools and services.
- `5` Security - Security tools and backends like user management.
- `6` Troubleshooting and recovery - Guides on fixing various system problems.
