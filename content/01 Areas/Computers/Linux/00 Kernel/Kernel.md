The Linux kernel is a open source monolithic unix like kernel. On a typical linux system the kernel file will be found at `/boot` and is usually named `vmlinuz` but on some systems such as ARM it may be named `Image`. When changing kernel versions it is important to reflect these changes onto your [[Boot Loader|boot loader]].

## Types of kernel
- **Stable** - Vanilla Linux kernel and modules
- **Hardened** — A security-focused Linux kernel
- **Longterm** — Long-term support also referred as (LTS)
- **Zen** - Created by kernel hackers to provide the best linux experience
