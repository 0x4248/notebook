# Network Models and Types

***
## 7 OSI Layers
- **Physical Layer**: This is the physical elements that transmit data, such as cables, switches, and hubs.
- **Data Link Layer**: This layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining a reliable link between two devices on a network. This includes MAC addressing and error detection.
- **Network Layer**: This layer is responsible for routing data packets between different networks. This includes IP addressing and routing protocols.
- **Transport Layer**: This layer is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. This includes protocols such as TCP and UDP.
- **Session Layer**: This layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions between applications on different devices.
- **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for translating data into a format that can be understood by the application layer. This includes data encryption and compression.
- **Application Layer**: This layer is responsible for providing services to applications, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.
## TCP/IP Model
- **Network Interface Layer**: This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a network. This includes protocols such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
- **Internet Layer**: This layer is responsible for routing data packets between different networks. This includes IP addressing and routing protocols.
- **Transport Layer**
- **Application Layer**
