# Networking Devices and Connectors

***

## Hubs
Hubs connect devices in a network by broadcasting data to all connected devices. They operate at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and do not filter or manage traffic.

## Switches
Switches connect devices in a network and use MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended recipient.

## Modem
Modems (modulator-demodulator) convert digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines and vice versa.

More modern modems are used in cable and fibre-optic internet connections.

## Access Point (AP)
Access Points allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi or related standards.
