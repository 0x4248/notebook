# Core Principles of Computer Networking

***
## Types of networks
- Local area networks (LANs) - Cover a small geographic area, such as a home or office building.
    - LAN's are often wired using Ethernet cables and switches.
    - They can be wireless using WAP's. This would be called a WLAN (Wireless local area network).
- Metropolitan area network (MAN) - Covers a City, Town or Campus area.
- Personal area network (PAN) - Covers a very small area, typically a few meters.
    - Examples include Bluetooth and NFC (Near Field Communication).
