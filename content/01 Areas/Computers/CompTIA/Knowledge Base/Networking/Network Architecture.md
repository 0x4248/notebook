# Network Architecture

***

Computer networks allow computers to exchange data and share resources between them. Networks also use various architectures and protocols to facilitate communication and ensure data integrity.

## Types of endpoints
- **Clients** - Devices that send requests for services or resources.
- **Servers** - Devices that serve a service to clients or other servers.
- **Peers** - Devices that can act as both clients and servers. They share resources and services with each other such as in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.

## Redistribution points
- **Switches** - Devices that connect multiple devices on a network and use MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.
