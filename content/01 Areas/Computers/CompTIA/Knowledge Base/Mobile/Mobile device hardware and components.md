# Mobile device hardware and components

***

## Key components 
- [[#Batteries]]
- [[#Keyboards & Keys]]
- [[#Random Access Memory]]
- Hard Disk Drives & Solid-State Drives
- Wireless Cards
- Wi-Fi Antennas
- Cameras & Webcams
- Microphones

### Batteries
This component powers the device and is rechargeable. Comes in the form of a lithium ion (Li-ion) or lithium polymer (Li-poly / LiPo) battery.

Overtime these batteries will need replacing as they lose their ability to hold a charge. 

>[!note]
> It is advised that you charge using the manufacturer's charger to avoid damage to the battery and replacing the damaged battery may not be possible on some devices.

### Keyboards & Keys
Physical keyboards and touch sensitive (may also be virtual). Mobile phones have many keyboard features like haptic feedback on key press and non standardised key layouts for smaller screens.

### Random Access Memory
RAM is used to store data temporarily while the device is on. RAM is volatile memory so when the device is powered off, all data in RAM is lost.

#### SODIMM
Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SODIMM) is a smaller version of the standard DIMM used in desktops.

>[!tip]+ SODIMM Pin Types
> - DDR3 - 204 pins
> - DDR4 - 260 pins
> - DDR5 - 262 pins

## Hard Disk Drives & Solid-State Drives
Storage drives store the operating system files, applications and user data. These storage devices will be connected using a interface. There are also two primary types of storage drives.

### HDD
- Mechanical and uses magnets to store data on a spinning disk.
- Slower than solid state drives
### SSD
- Non mechanical
- SSD's provide faster storage and performance
- SSD's are also shock proof and much more durable compared to HDD's.
- Lower power consumption.

### Interfaces
| Name          | SATA                                          | MSATA                              | NVME                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Full name     | Serial ATA                                    | Mini SATA                          | Non-Volatile Memory Express           |
| Usage         | Most common connector used in SSD's and HDD's | Smaller interface used for laptops | High speed interface using PCIe lanes |
| Speed         | Speeds: 1.5Gbps - 6Gbps                       | SATA speeds                        | Much faster than SATA                 |
| Best use case | General use                                   | General use for mobile devices     | Gaming and Video editing              |

#### NVME Connection types
- M.2 - Small form factor card that connects directly to the motherboard.
- PCIe - Expansion card that fits into a PCIe slot on the motherboard.
##### M.2 Form factors
Below is a table explaining the form factors of M.2 drives.

>[!note]
> **M.2 is not just for storage devices**.
> 
> Many wifi cards, bluetooth cards and other expansion cards use the M.2 form factor.

| Name   | 2230 | 2242 | 2260 | 2280 | 22110 |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Width  | 22mm | 22mm | 22mm | 22mm | 22mm  |
| Length | 30mm | 42mm | 60mm | 80mm | 110mm |
