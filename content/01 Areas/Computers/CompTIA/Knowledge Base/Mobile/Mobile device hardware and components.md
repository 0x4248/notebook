### Batteries
This component powers the device and is rechargeable. Comes in the form of a lithium ion (Li-ion) or lithium polymer (Li-poly / LiPo) battery.

Overtime these batteries will need replacing as they lose their ability to hold a charge. 

>[!note]
> It is advised that you charge using the manufacturer's charger to avoid damage to the battery and replacing the damaged battery may not be possible on some devices.

### Keyboards & Keys
Physical keyboards and touch sensitive (may also be virtual). Mobile phones have many keyboard features like haptic feedback on key press and non standardised key layouts for smaller screens.

### Random Access Memory
RAM is used to store data temporarily while the device is on. RAM is volatile memory so when the device is powered off, all data in RAM is lost.

#### SODIMM
Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SODIMM) is a smaller version of the standard DIMM used in desktops.
