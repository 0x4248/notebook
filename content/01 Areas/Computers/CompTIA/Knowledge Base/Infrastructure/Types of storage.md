# Types of storage

***

In this topic we will cover the different types of storage devices and media.
- **Solid State Drives (SSD)**
    - Reliable and fast storage option.
    - No moving parts, making them more durable.
    - Uses flash memory to store data.
    - More expensive than traditional hard drives.
- **Hard Disk Drives (HDD)**
	- Traditional storage option.
	- Uses spinning disks to read and write data.
	- More affordable than SSDs.
	- Slower than SSDs due to mechanical parts.
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**
	- Volatile memory used for temporary data storage while the device is powered on.
	- Faster than SSDs and HDDs.
	- Data is fully lost when the device is powered off.
	- Comes in DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 types. Newer types are faster.
- **Network Storage**
    - Storage accessed over a network.
    - Includes Network Attached Storage (NAS) and cloud storage.
    - Allows for data sharing and collaboration.
    - Can be slow if network connection is poor.
- **Hybrid Storage**
		- Combines SSD and HDD technologies.
		- Frequently accessed data is stored on the SSD for speed.
		- Less frequently accessed data is stored on the HDD for capacity.
		- Balances performance and cost.
