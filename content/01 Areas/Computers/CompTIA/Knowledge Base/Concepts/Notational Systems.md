# Notational Systems

***
## What is a notational system?
In short its how we count and represent numbers. Most commonly you would find these systems:
- Decimal/Base 10 - 1, 2, 3, 4 (Wont go over this, *you should know this from lower school*)
- Binary - 1010
- Hexadecimal - 0xF3

## Binary
*See also from other parts of this notebook:* [[Binary]], [[Binary Arithmetic]].

Binary is a number system that uses binary digits `1` and `0`. This is also called "Base 2" since it only has two digits.

### Binary table
You can use a binary table to calculate binary numbers. *Its how I like to do it. But some people do it in their head.*

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   | Equals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0      |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 132    |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 15     |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 16     |
