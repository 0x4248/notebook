# Collecting like terms

***

Think of collecting like terms as grouping up similar items together to make the overall expression simpler.

$$
\begin{aligned}
a + a &= 2a \\
a + b + a &= 2a + b \\
a + b + c + a &= 2a + b + c \\
5a + 20b + 3a &= 20b + 8a \\
 
\end{aligned}
$$
If there are constants involved then you can also collect those:

$$
\begin{aligned}
5a + 20b + 3a + 10 &= 20b + 8a + 10 \\
5a + 20b + 3a + 10 + 2 &= 20b + 8a + 12 \\
(a3 + 2) + (a + 5) &= 4a + 7 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
